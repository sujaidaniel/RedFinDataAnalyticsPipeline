### Procedure for Setting Up a Data Pipeline for Redfin Housing Market Analysis

---

#### **Step 1: Set Up the EC2 Instance**
1. Launch an **EC2 instance** on AWS with the appropriate AMI (Ubuntu recommended).
2. Connect to the instance using SSH.
3. Update the system and install essential tools:
   - Python 3 and related tools (e.g., pip, virtual environment).
   - Airflow and AWS CLI for orchestration and integration with AWS services.
4. Configure the **AWS CLI** to authenticate and interact with S3 and other AWS services.
5. Start the Airflow web server to manage the ETL pipeline.

#### **Step 2: Develop the Airflow DAG**
1. Create a DAG in Airflow to orchestrate the ETL process.
2. Define the **extract, transform, and load (ETL)** tasks:
   - **Extract:** Download Redfin housing data from a public S3 bucket or URL.
   - **Transform:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality (e.g., remove nulls, format columns).
   - **Load:** Upload the transformed data to a target S3 bucket for downstream processes.
3. Configure dependencies between tasks to ensure the pipeline executes sequentially.

#### **Step 3: Configure Snowflake**
1. Log in to your Snowflake account and set up the following:
   - **Database and schema** to store Redfin data.
   - **Table structure** matching the Redfin dataset's columns.
2. Create a **file format object** in Snowflake to define how data files will be parsed (e.g., CSV format with specific delimiters).
3. Verify the table and schema setup with sample queries.

#### **Step 4: Automate Data Ingestion with Snowpipe**
1. Create a **Snowflake stage** that points to the S3 bucket where the transformed data is stored.
2. Configure a **Snowpipe** to automate data ingestion:
   - Define a COPY INTO statement in the Snowpipe to load data from the stage into the Snowflake table.
   - Enable **auto-ingest** to trigger the Snowpipe whenever new data is added to the S3 bucket.
3. Set up an **S3 event notification** to notify Snowflake of new files using AWS Lambda or other integration mechanisms.

#### **Step 5: Visualize Data in Power BI**
1. Connect Power BI to Snowflake using the appropriate connector and credentials.
2. Import the Redfin housing market data from Snowflake into Power BI.
3. Create custom dashboards to visualize insights, such as:
   - Median sale prices by city and property type.
   - Trends in housing supply and demand.
   - Seasonal variations in housing market metrics.

#### **Step 6: Test and Monitor**
1. Test the entire pipeline end-to-end to ensure seamless execution of:
   - Data extraction from the source.
   - Transformation and upload to S3.
   - Automated ingestion into Snowflake.
   - Visualization in Power BI.
2. Set up monitoring and alerting for the pipeline to identify and resolve issues quickly.

By following these steps, you can efficiently build and manage a robust data pipeline to analyze housing market trends using AWS, Airflow, Snowflake, and Power BI.
